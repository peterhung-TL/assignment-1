overview of project:
The site I chose to build is for a real band motifs. Motifs is a Singaporean pop band formed in Singapore in 2019. This quintet comprise of 3 guitarists, a base, a drummer as well as a vocalist. The band cites influences from ‘90s shoegaze, post-punk, and dream-pop acts, with the combination of pleasant melodies with reverb=drenched nostalgia. The band has released an album earlier this year called “remember a stranger” this year and has slowly climbed the ladder, and hence even getting gigs from other countries such as Tokyo.  Before expanding internationally, the band has also built a reputation locally for their mesmerising live performances through many showcase opportunities back in 2022 such as Baybeats Budding Programming and was even part of the Mosaic Music series end of April this year. 

design process:
When I chose to build this site, I wanted to make their site having a similar colour scheme with their song cover page, where there would be contrast between their song covers and overall colour scheme. My main goal is to make the site user-friendly and easy to navigate, minimising difficulties on performing the act they want. which would hopefully attract the  younger generation in Singapore. I also wanted to showcase their new projects in the site as well as popular merchandise on the main page, making it more eye catching which will hopefully make people be more inclined to buy them. I took inspiration from the websites from other artists by looking at different layout methods and created something original. 

features:
